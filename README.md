System Manager for GNU/Linux


## Introduction

I want to create a web-based system administration tool for GNU/Linux. At the moment, this tool really doesn't do much at all. However, I'd like to create a set of tools to simplify Linux system administration.


## Planned Features

* Manual and automated rsync backups
* dd disk cloning
* User account management
* Package management, probably starting with the snap package manager
* Other tedious terminal tasks
